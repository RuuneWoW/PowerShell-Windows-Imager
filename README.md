# PS-Image
## Intro
This script will help you image a Windows computer that needs to become part of a domain.
It was written to be used in a Dell environment with the inclusion of Dell Command update, so if you are not using it on a Dell, just remove this code.
Please read throught the code carefully to make sure that all components are needed within your environment and that all paths have been correctly added. 
I have put a comment everywhere that you should have to edit in your own path or license key. 
Also note that certain parts refer to a webpage for a download, so if you have any issues, make sure that the site had not changed.

## Pre Requirements 
1. A Windows computer that has been joined to your domain
2. [Invoke-RemoveBuiltinApps.ps1](https://github.com/MSEndpointMgr/ConfigMgr/blob/master/Operating%20System%20Deployment/Invoke-RemoveBuiltinApps.ps1) by Nickolaj Andersen
